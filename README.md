# EchoFi - Social Content Rewards Platform

## The Problem

Content creators and social media influencers in the Web3 space face several challenges:

1. **Limited Monetization**: Despite creating valuable content about blockchain projects, creators often struggle to monetize their efforts directly.
2. **Fragmented Rewards**: Projects wanting to reward content creators lack streamlined ways to distribute incentives.
3. **Quality Control**: The space is flooded with low-quality content as there's no structured incentive system for quality.
4. **Engagement Tracking**: Difficulty in tracking and verifying genuine engagement with content.

## The Solution

EchoFi is a SocialFi platform that bridges the gap between blockchain projects and content creators by providing an automated reward system for quality social media content.

## How It Works

1. **Project Campaigns**: Projects create campaigns and allocate tokens for rewards
2. **Content Creation**: Users create and post content about projects on Twitter
3. **Automated Tracking**: Our system tracks post engagement metrics
4. **Smart Distribution**: Rewards are automatically distributed based on performance
